# macposts

A toolkit for transportation network modeling. To install from the repository,
first ensure a working C++ toolchain (note that MSVC is not supported now and we
appreciate any help on the Windows build) and CMake â‰¥ 3.10. Then clone this
repository (with `--recurse-submodules` ), and run at the project root:

```sh
pip install .
```

For development, run

```sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```

instead to also install the development tools and enable editable mode.
